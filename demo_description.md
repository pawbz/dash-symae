### Introduction

SymAE is a novel physics-embedded deep-network architecture that can easily make sense of large amounts of passive seismic datasets. SymAE learns to represent seismic noise such that its source and path effects are disentangled in order to facilitate easy monitoring of these effects. For the first time, we can now "mix and match" seismic data, i.e. synthesize data with the source of one (baseline) seismogram, and with the medium of another (monitor) one.

### Hybrid Datapoints
"Virtual sources" during monitoring corresponding to the baseline survey.
